# Call History & Sessions

The Call History feature provides a comprehensive searchable database of all your voice AI conversations. Search through thousands of calls, apply advanced filters, review full transcripts, and analyze individual session performance.

## Overview

Call History is your system's memory—every conversation is logged, transcribed, and made searchable. Whether you need to review a specific call from last week or analyze patterns across thousands of sessions, Call History gives you the tools to find exactly what you need.

### Key Capabilities

- **Complete call archive**: Every conversation automatically saved
- **Advanced search**: Find calls by ID, agent, status, duration, and more
- **Multi-level filtering**: Combine filters for precise results
- **Sortable columns**: Sort by time, duration, or cost
- **Detailed transcripts**: Full conversation history with timestamps
- **Audio playback**: Listen to recorded calls
- **Performance metrics**: Per-call analytics
- **Bulk operations**: View and analyze multiple calls

<Info>
Call History is separate from the Live Calls feature. Live Calls shows active conversations from the last 10 minutes, while Call History contains your complete archive of all calls (active and completed).
</Info>

## Accessing Call History

The Call History feature is available as a dedicated page:

1. Navigate to **Call History** from the main navigation menu
2. The call history table loads with your most recent calls
3. Apply filters and search as needed

```
Main Menu > Call History
```

**Default view**:

- Shows calls with status: IN_PROGRESS and COMPLETED
- Sorted by time (newest first)
- Displays 10 calls per page
- All agents included

## Understanding Call Statuses

Every call in the system has one of five possible statuses:

### Status Types

**PENDING**

- Call has been initiated but not yet started
- Waiting for connection or agent availability
- Color: Yellow badge

```
Example: Outbound call queued but not yet dialing
```

**IN_PROGRESS**

- Call is currently active
- Conversation is ongoing
- Color: Blue badge with pulsing indicator

```
Example: Customer is talking to AI agent right now
```

**COMPLETED**

- Call finished successfully
- Full transcript and audio available
- Color: Green badge

```
Example: Normal call that ended gracefully
```

**NO_ANSWER**

- Call was initiated but not answered
- No conversation took place
- Color: Gray badge

```
Example: Outbound call rang but nobody picked up
```

**FAILED**

- Call encountered an error and couldn't complete
- May have technical issues
- Color: Red badge

```
Example: Connection dropped, system error, invalid number
```

<Warning>
By default, the table shows only IN_PROGRESS and COMPLETED calls. To see failed or unanswered calls, modify the status filter.
</Warning>

- Date range: Last 7 days
- Sort: Time descending

Analysis:
1. Review all failed calls
2. Look for patterns in transcripts
3. Check performance metrics
4. Identify common failure points
```

**Example 2: Channel comparison**

```
Goal: Compare Web vs Phone performance

Process:
1. Filter: Channel = Web, Status = Completed
2. Note average duration and outcomes
3. Filter: Channel = Phone, Status = Completed
4. Compare metrics
5. Identify which channel performs better
```

**Example 3: Quality spot check**

```
Goal: Random quality review

Setup:
- Status: Completed
- Duration: Is between 60 and 300 (1-5 minutes)
- Date: This week
- Sort: Random (use page navigation)

Method:
1. Apply filters
2. Review calls from different pages
3. Ensure good distribution
```

### Saved Filters (Future Enhancement)

While not currently implemented, you might want to manually track useful filter combinations:

**Recommended filter sets**:

```
"Failed Calls Today"
- Status: Failed
- Date: Today
- Sort: Time descending

"Long Calls This Week"
- Status: Completed
- Duration: > 300
- Date: This week
- Sort: Duration descending

"High Cost Review"
- Status: Completed
- Sort: Cost descending
- Limit: Top 50
```

<Tip>
Bookmark URLs with your common filter combinations applied. The filters persist in the URL query string, making them shareable and reusable.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Calls Not Appearing

**Problem**: Expected calls don't show in the table

**Check**:

1. **Status filter**: Ensure the call's status is checked

   - Example: Looking for a failed call but only "Completed" is checked

2. **Date range**: Verify date range includes when the call occurred

   - Expand to "This Month" or "Custom" with wider range

3. **Agent filter**: Confirm correct agent is selected or use "All agents"

4. **Pagination**: Call may be on a different page

   - Check total count at bottom
   - Navigate through pages

5. **Search/filters**: Clear all filters and try again
   - Click "Reset" or "Clear Filters"

### Can't Play Audio Recording

**Problem**: Audio player shows error or doesn't load

**Solutions**:

1. **Call still in progress**: Audio only available for completed calls

   - Wait for call to complete

2. **Browser compatibility**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge

   - Some browsers have limited audio codec support

3. **Recording not available**: Some calls may not have recordings

   - Check call status and metadata
   - Verify recording was enabled for this session

4. **Network issue**: Slow connection may timeout
   - Refresh page and try again
   - Check internet connection

### Transcript Missing or Incomplete

**Problem**: Conversation tab shows no transcript or partial transcript

**Possible causes**:

1. **Call in progress**: Transcript builds as call proceeds

   - Refresh to see latest messages

2. **ASR failure**: Speech recognition failed for some segments

   - Check Overview tab for ASR errors
   - May see gaps in transcript

3. **Data not synced**: Brief delay in transcript availability

   - Wait 30-60 seconds after call ends
   - Refresh drawer

4. **Audio quality issues**: Poor connection led to transcription failure
   - Review audio quality in recording
   - Check ASR processing times in Overview

### Slow Table Loading

**Problem**: Call history table takes long time to load

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce date range**: Narrow from "This Month" to "This Week"
2. **Apply filters**: Load fewer calls by filtering
3. **Reduce page size**: Use 10 or 25 instead of 100 per page
4. **Check network**: Slow connection affects load time
5. **Clear browser cache**: Old cached data may cause issues

<Tip>
For best performance, avoid loading hundreds of calls at once. Use filters to narrow results, then paginate through as needed.
</Tip>

### Column Sorting Not Working

**Problem**: Clicking column headers doesn't sort

**Check**:

1. **Look for sort indicator**: Arrow icon should appear in column header
2. **Ensure column is sortable**: Not all columns may support sorting
3. **Refresh page**: Browser state may be stale
4. **Try different column**: Verify sorting works at all

## Data Export (Future Enhancement)

While direct CSV export may not be currently available, here are workarounds:

### Manual Export Methods

**Option 1: Browser copy-paste**

1. Select all visible rows in table
2. Copy (Cmd+C or Ctrl+C)
3. Paste into spreadsheet application
4. Repeat for additional pages if needed

**Option 2: Transcript export**

1. Open call details drawer
2. Select and copy transcript text
3. Save to text file
4. Repeat for multiple calls as needed

**Option 3: Use browser developer tools**

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Network tab → Find API call to call-history endpoint
3. Copy JSON response
4. Parse JSON with script or converter
5. Import to spreadsheet

<Note>
Check with your administrator about API access for programmatic call history export if you need bulk data regularly.
