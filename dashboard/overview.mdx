# Dashboard Overview

The Dashboard Overview provides a comprehensive view of your voice AI system's performance, displaying key metrics, session statistics, and call distribution analytics. This centralized monitoring interface helps you track system activity and make data-driven decisions.

## Overview Tab

The Overview tab is your primary view for monitoring overall system performance. It displays real-time metrics and historical data based on your selected filters.

### Accessing the Overview

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** from the main navigation menu
2. The **Overview** tab opens by default
3. Use the filter controls at the top to refine your view:
   - **Agent Filter**: Select "All agents" or a specific voice agent
   - **Date Range**: Choose from preset ranges or custom dates

<Info>
The Overview tab automatically refreshes when you return to it after viewing call details, ensuring you always see the latest data.
</Info>

## Overall Information Metrics

The top section displays four primary metrics that provide a snapshot of your system's activity:

### Live Sessions

**What it tracks**: The number of concurrent active calls happening right now.

**Use cases**:

- Monitor real-time system load
- Identify peak usage times
- Ensure adequate capacity during high-traffic periods

```
Example: 5 Live Sessions
Meaning: Five calls are currently in progress
```

<Tip>
If you frequently see high numbers of live sessions, consider scaling your infrastructure or reviewing your agent configuration for optimization opportunities.
</Tip>

### Total Sessions

**What it tracks**: The total number of completed sessions within your selected date range.

**Use cases**:

- Track call volume over time
- Compare performance across different time periods
- Measure system utilization

```
Example: 1,247 Total Sessions
With filter: Today
Meaning: 1,247 calls occurred today
```

### Average Session Duration

**What it tracks**: The mean duration of all sessions in your selected time range, displayed in minutes and seconds (e.g., "2m 34s").

**Use cases**:

- Understand typical conversation length
- Identify agents that may need optimization
- Benchmark against expected call durations

```
Example: 2m 34s
Meaning: On average, calls last 2 minutes and 34 seconds
```

<Warning>
Very short average durations (under 30 seconds) may indicate call quality issues or premature disconnections. Investigate call logs to identify the root cause.
</Warning>

### Total Session Duration

**What it tracks**: The cumulative time of all sessions combined, displayed in hours and minutes (e.g., "52h 18m").

**Use cases**:

- Calculate total system utilization
- Estimate resource consumption
- Track trends in overall usage

```
Example: 52h 18m
Meaning: All calls combined totaled 52 hours and 18 minutes
```

## Additional Metrics

The Additional Metrics section provides deeper insights into call patterns and agent performance:

### Calls by Duration Bucket

This metric categorizes calls into three duration ranges:

- **Less than 30s**: Very short calls (often quick queries or disconnections)
- **30-120s**: Medium-length calls (standard conversations)
- **More than 120s**: Long calls (complex issues or extended interactions)

**Example**:

```
Less than 30s: 45 calls
30-120s: 892 calls
More than 120s: 310 calls
```

**Analysis tips**:

- High numbers in the "Less than 30s" bucket may indicate:
  - Connection issues
  - Misrouted calls
  - Users hanging up quickly (potential UX problem)
- Most calls should fall in the 30-120s range for typical use cases
- Many long calls might suggest:
  - Complex customer needs
  - Agent requires better training
  - Opportunities for workflow optimization

<Note>
The duration buckets are fixed at 30 and 120 seconds. These thresholds are designed based on typical voice AI interaction patterns.
</Note>

### Average Words per AI Response

**What it tracks**: The average number of words the AI agent uses in each response.

**Use cases**:

- Ensure responses are concise yet informative
- Identify verbose agents that may need tuning
- Optimize for natural conversation flow

```
Example: 42 words per response
Ideal range: 20-60 words
```

**Optimization guidelines**:

- **Too low (< 20 words)**: Responses may be too terse or unhelpful
- **Optimal (20-60 words)**: Natural, conversational responses
- **Too high (> 80 words)**: May overwhelm users or sound robotic

<Tip>
If your average is consistently above 60 words, review your agent's prompt engineering to encourage more concise responses while maintaining helpfulness.
</Tip>

### Forwarded to Human Agent

**What it tracks**: The percentage of calls that were escalated to a human agent.

**Use cases**:

- Measure AI containment rate
- Identify areas where the AI needs improvement
- Calculate ROI of your voice AI system

```
Example: 12%
Meaning: 12% of calls required human intervention
```

**Target benchmarks**:

- **Excellent (< 10%)**: High AI containment, well-trained agent
- **Good (10-20%)**: Acceptable performance with room for improvement
- **Needs attention (> 20%)**: Consider agent training improvements

## Visualizations and Charts

The Overview tab includes two interactive charts for data visualization:

### Calls by Duration Bucket (Pie Chart)

**What it shows**: Visual distribution of calls across the three duration buckets.

**How to use it**:

1. Hover over segments to see exact counts and percentages
2. Quickly identify which duration range dominates
3. Spot unusual patterns (e.g., spike in very short calls)

**Interpretation example**:

```
If the pie chart shows:
- 5% Less than 30s
- 70% 30-120s
- 25% More than 120s

This is a healthy distribution indicating:
- Few dropped/failed calls
- Majority are standard conversations
- Some complex inquiries requiring more time
```

### Calls Over Time (Line Chart)

**What it shows**: The volume of calls across time, with granularity based on your selected date range:

- **Today or Yesterday**: Hourly breakdown
- **This Week**: Daily breakdown
- **This Month**: Daily breakdown
- **Custom range**: Automatically adjusts (hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly)

**How to use it**:

1. Identify peak usage hours or days
2. Spot trends (increasing/decreasing call volume)
3. Plan maintenance windows during low-traffic periods
4. Allocate resources based on predicted demand

**Example scenarios**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Hourly Pattern">
    ```
    Peak hours: 10 AM - 2 PM (300+ calls/hour)
    Low hours: 2 AM - 6 AM (< 10 calls/hour)

    Action: Schedule system updates between 2-6 AM
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Daily Pattern">
    ```
    Weekdays: Average 1,200 calls/day
    Weekends: Average 400 calls/day

    Action: Reduce infrastructure on weekends to save costs
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Trend Analysis">
    ```
    Week 1: 5,000 calls
    Week 2: 6,200 calls
    Week 3: 7,500 calls

    Observation: 20-25% weekly growth
    Action: Plan capacity expansion
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Filtering Your Data

The Overview tab supports powerful filtering to help you drill down into specific data:

### Agent Filter

Filter data by specific voice agents to compare performance:

```
Use case: Compare Agent A vs. Agent B
1. Select "Agent A" from the dropdown
2. Note the metrics (avg duration, escalation rate, etc.)
3. Select "Agent B"
4. Compare the metrics to identify the better performer
```

<Info>
The agent filter applies to all metrics and charts on the Overview tab. When "All agents" is selected, you see aggregated data across your entire system.
</Info>

### Date Range Filter

Choose from preset ranges or create custom date ranges:

**Preset options**:

- **Today**: Current day (midnight to now)
- **Yesterday**: Previous full day
- **This Week**: Sunday to today (week starts on Sunday)
- **This Month**: First day of month to today
- **Custom**: Select any start and end date

**Timezone handling**:
<Note>
All times are displayed in your browser's local timezone. The system automatically converts UTC timestamps from the backend to ensure accuracy.
</Note>

**Custom range example**:

```
Scenario: Analyze Black Friday weekend performance

1. Click Date Range filter
2. Select "Custom"
3. Start date: Nov 24, 2024
4. End date: Nov 26, 2024
5. Click "Done"

Result: View metrics for just that 3-day period
```

<Warning>
Custom date ranges cannot include future dates. If you select a future end date, you'll see an error message: "Future dates are not allowed."
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Daily Monitoring

Check these metrics every day:

1. **Live Sessions**: Ensure it's within expected range
2. **Total Sessions**: Compare to previous day for anomalies
3. **Forwarded to Human Agent**: Track escalation trends

### Weekly Review

Perform these analyses weekly:

1. Compare current week to previous week for trends
2. Review the Calls Over Time chart for unusual patterns
3. Check if Average Session Duration is increasing or decreasing
4. Analyze duration bucket distribution for changes

### Monthly Optimization

Use monthly data to:

1. Calculate month-over-month growth
2. Identify long-term trends
3. Set performance goals for next month
4. Review agent performance and make adjustments

## Troubleshooting

### "No Data Available" Message

**Problem**: Charts show "No data available for the selected time period"

**Solutions**:

1. Verify you have calls in the selected date range
2. Try selecting "All agents" if a specific agent is filtered
3. Expand your date range (e.g., from "Today" to "This Week")
4. Check if the selected project has any configured agents

### Metrics Show Zero

**Problem**: All metrics display 0 or "--"

**Possible causes**:

1. **No project selected**: Select a project from the project dropdown
2. **No calls in range**: Your selected date range has no activity
3. **Agent filter mismatch**: The filtered agent has no calls
4. **Loading state**: Wait a few seconds for data to load

### Slow Loading

**Problem**: Dashboard takes a long time to load metrics

**Solutions**:

1. **Reduce date range**: Large ranges (multiple months) process more data
2. **Filter by agent**: Narrow down to specific agents instead of "All agents"
3. **Check network**: Slow connection may delay API responses
4. **Peak hours**: System may be slower during high-traffic times

<Tip>
For fastest performance, use preset date ranges (Today, Yesterday, This Week) rather than custom ranges spanning many months.
</Tip>
