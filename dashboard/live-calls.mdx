# Live Calls Monitoring

The Live Calls feature provides real-time monitoring of all active voice AI conversations. You can view ongoing calls, join as a silent listener, and access live transcription and call details—all from a single interface.

## Overview

The Live Calls tab refreshes automatically every 10 seconds, displaying all calls that are currently in progress or started within the last 10 minutes. This ensures you have an up-to-the-minute view of your system's activity.

### Key Features

- **Real-time updates**: Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- **Live duration tracking**: See how long each call has been active
- **Silent monitoring**: Join calls without the caller knowing
- **Live transcription**: View conversation in real-time
- **Call details drawer**: Deep dive into conversation context
- **Multi-channel support**: Monitor calls from Phone, Web, and WhatsApp

<Info>
The Live Calls tab only shows calls with status "IN_PROGRESS". Completed calls automatically disappear from this view and can be found in the Call History.
</Info>

## Accessing Live Calls

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** from the main menu
2. Click the **Live calls** tab

## Auto-Refresh Behavior

Understanding how auto-refresh works ensures you don't miss important calls:

### When Auto-Refresh is Active

The live calls list refreshes every 10 seconds when:

- You're viewing the Live calls tab
- No call details drawer is open
- The browser tab is active (in focus)

**What updates**:

- New calls appear automatically
- Ended calls disappear automatically
- Call durations update every second
- Call counts refresh

### When Auto-Refresh is Paused

Auto-refresh stops when:

- You open a call details drawer
- You switch to a different browser tab
- You navigate to another Dashboard tab

**Why it pauses**:

- Prevents jarring content shifts while reading
- Maintains stable UI when joining calls
- Reduces unnecessary API calls when you're not watching

<Info>
Auto-refresh resumes automatically when you close the drawer or return to the Live calls tab.
</Info>

### Manual Refresh

Force a refresh at any time:

1. Navigate away from the Live calls tab and back
2. Refresh your browser (F5 or Cmd+R)
3. Close and reopen the call details drawer

## Empty State

When no calls are active, you'll see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                         │
│              📞                         │
│                                         │
│         No Live Calls                   │
│                                         │
│  There are currently no live calls.     │
│  New calls will appear here in          │
│  real time.                             │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

<Note>
The empty state is normal during off-hours or low-traffic periods. The view will automatically populate when calls begin.
</Note>

## Real-World Use Cases

### Quality Assurance

**Scenario**: Monitor random calls to ensure agent quality

```
Process:
1. Set Agent Filter to "All agents"
2. Wait for calls to appear
3. Join 3-5 random calls throughout the day
4. Take notes on agent performance
5. Use insights to improve prompt engineering

Benefits:
- Catch issues before customers complain
- Identify training opportunities
- Validate agent improvements
```

### Troubleshooting

**Scenario**: User reports "AI not responding correctly"

```
Process:
1. Filter to the specific agent user mentioned
2. Wait for next call with that agent
3. Join the call to observe behavior
4. Monitor performance metrics for anomalies
5. Review live transcript for response quality

Metrics to watch:
- LLM Response Time (should be < 2000ms)
- Error indicators in transcript
- Unusual silence gaps
```

### Training and Onboarding

**Scenario**: New team member learning the system

```
Process:
1. Have trainee open Live calls tab
2. Join a call together (screen share)
3. Walk through the drawer interface
4. Explain performance metrics
5. Discuss agent response quality

Learning points:
- How calls flow through the system
- What "good" metrics look like
- How to identify problematic patterns
```

### Peak Load Monitoring

**Scenario**: Black Friday sale - expect high call volume

```
Setup:
1. Open Live calls tab on a dedicated monitor
2. Set to "All agents"
3. Watch for call volume spikes
4. Note if durations are increasing (system strain)
5. Join calls if many show high latency

Warning signs:
- 20+ concurrent calls (may need scaling)
- Latency > 3000ms (performance degradation)
- Many calls ending quickly (connection issues)
```

- ❌ Call abandoned before resolution

<Tip>
Create a checklist based on these criteria and score each monitored call. Track scores over time to measure improvement.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "No Live Calls" Shows But You Expect Activity

**Possible causes**:

1. **Time-based filtering**: Calls older than 10 minutes don't appear

   - Solution: Check Call History for recent completed calls

2. **Agent filter active**: Filtered agent has no current calls

   - Solution: Select "All agents" to see all calls

3. **Calls completed before load**: System had calls that just ended

   - Solution: Wait a few minutes for new calls

4. **No project selected**: Dashboard requires active project
   - Solution: Select project from project dropdown

### Join Button Not Working

**Symptoms**: Clicking Join does nothing or shows error

**Solutions**:

1. **Check browser permissions**: Allow microphone access

   ```
   Chrome: Settings > Privacy > Site Settings > Microphone
   ```

2. **Network connectivity**: Ensure stable internet connection

   - LiveKit requires WebRTC support
   - Check firewall doesn't block WebRTC ports

3. **Call already ended**: Call may have ended between viewing and clicking

   - Solution: Refresh and try another call

4. **Browser compatibility**: Use Chrome, Firefox, or Edge (latest versions)
   - Safari may have limited WebRTC support

### Can't Hear Audio After Joining

**Troubleshooting steps**:

1. **Volume settings**: Check system and browser volume
2. **Audio output device**: Verify correct speakers/headphones selected
3. **Browser audio permissions**: Ensure site can play audio
4. **LiveKit connection**: Look for connection status indicator
5. **Call audio quality**: May be silence in conversation at that moment

<Warning>
If you experience persistent audio issues, leave and rejoin the call. If problems continue, check your browser console for WebRTC errors.
</Warning>

### Drawer Won't Close

**Symptoms**: X button doesn't close drawer or drawer freezes

**Solutions**:

1. **Leave call first**: Click "Leave Call" before closing drawer
2. **Wait for processing**: Give 2-3 seconds after clicking
3. **Force close**: Refresh browser (you'll be disconnected from call)
4. **Check browser console**: Look for JavaScript errors

### Live Transcription Not Updating

**Expected behavior**: Transcription appears 2-3 seconds after speech

**If transcription is missing**:

1. **Still connecting**: Wait 5-10 seconds after joining
2. **Silent period**: No one is speaking at the moment
3. **ASR issues**: Check Overview tab for ASR processing errors
4. **Refresh drawer**: Close and reopen call details

## Privacy and Compliance

### Silent Listener Mode

<Warning>
You join calls as a silent listener—the caller is NOT notified. Ensure your use complies with:
- Call recording laws in your jurisdiction
- Company privacy policies
- User consent agreements
</Warning>

**Legal considerations**:

- **One-party consent states**: May be legal if AI agent is party to call
- **Two-party consent states**: May require disclosure in greeting
- **International calls**: Different countries have different laws

**Best practices**:

- Include call monitoring disclosure in your agent's greeting
- Document your call monitoring policy
- Train staff on appropriate use of monitoring features
- Only join calls for legitimate business purposes (QA, training, troubleshooting)

### Data Handling

**What gets recorded**:

- Audio of the full conversation
- Complete transcript
- Performance metrics
- Caller metadata (if provided)

**Data retention**:

- Calls stored according to your account settings
- Transcripts searchable in Call History
- Access logs for monitoring activities

<Info>
Consult with your legal team to ensure your use of live call monitoring complies with applicable regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or industry-specific requirements.
