# Debugging & Validation

Master the tools and techniques for validating, testing, and debugging your Flow Agents to ensure they work perfectly in production.

---

## Validation System

Hamsa's built-in validation system checks your flow for errors before you can save or deploy.

### Real-Time Validation

The validation system runs continuously as you build:

```yaml
Validation Triggers:
  - When you add/edit a node
  - When you create/modify a transition
  - When you connect edges
  - When you change global settings
  - Before saving the flow
  - Before deploying to production
```

### Validation Indicator

```yaml
Header Validation Badge:
  ✅ Green checkmark: No errors
  ⚠️  Yellow warning: Issues found (non-blocking)
  ❌ Red X: Critical errors (blocks saving)

Click badge to see:
  - Total error count
  - Errors grouped by node
  - Specific error messages
  - "Focus" button to jump to problematic node
```

### Validation Categories

#### 1. Workflow-Level Errors

**Missing Start Node**:

```yaml
Error: 'Workflow must have exactly one start node'
Cause: No start node exists or multiple start nodes
Fix: Add a start node or remove duplicates
```

**Empty System Instructions**:

```yaml
Error: 'System instructions are required'
Cause: Global settings system prompt is empty
Fix: Add system prompt in global settings
Location: Global Settings → System Prompt
```

#### 2. Node-Level Errors

**Empty Message**:

```yaml
Error: 'Message is required'
Node: Conversation Node "Welcome_User"
Cause: Message field is empty
Fix: Add message content
```

**Missing Tool Selection**:

```yaml
Error: 'Tool selection is required'
Node: Tool Node "Lookup_Account"
Cause: No tool selected
Fix: Click "Select Tool" and choose a tool
```

**Invalid Phone Number**:

```yaml
Error: 'Invalid phone number format'
Node: Transfer Call Node "Transfer_to_Support"
Cause: Phone number doesn't match format +1234567890
Fix: Use international format (e.g., +15551234567)
```

**Missing Agent Selection**:

```yaml
Error: 'Agent selection is required'
Node: Transfer Agent Node "Transfer_to_Human"
Cause: No agent/agent pool selected
Fix: Select an agent from the dropdown
```

#### 3. Variable Errors

**Invalid Variable Name**:

```yaml
Error: "Variable #1: Name must be in snake_case format"
Node: Conversation Node "Collect_Info"
Cause: Variable named "customerName" (camelCase)
Fix: Rename to "customer_name"

Valid Format:
  - Starts with letter
  - Lowercase only
  - Underscores allowed
  - No spaces or special characters
  Examples: customer_name, account_id, order_total
```

**Missing Variable Name**:

```yaml
Error: 'Variable #2: Name is required'
Node: Tool Node "API_Call"
Cause: Variable extraction configured but name is empty
Fix: Provide a variable name
```

**Short Description (Conversation Nodes)**:

```yaml
Error: 'Variable #1: Description must be at least 10 characters'
Node: Conversation Node "Get_Details"
Cause: Description is "name" (4 characters)
Fix: Provide detailed description (e.g., "The customer's full name for account lookup")
```

**Missing Extraction Prompt (Conversation Nodes)**:

```yaml
Error: 'Variable #3: Extraction prompt is required'
Node: Conversation Node "Collect_Phone"
Cause: Extraction prompt is empty
Fix: Add prompt like "Extract the phone number the customer provides"
```

**Missing JSON Path (Tool Nodes)**:

```yaml
Error: 'Variable #1: JSON path is required'
Node: Tool Node "API_Lookup"
Cause: JSON path field is empty
Fix: Add JSON path like "$.data.customer.email"
```

#### 4. Transition Errors

**Empty Transition Description**:

```yaml
Error: 'All transitions must have descriptions'
Node: Conversation Node "Menu"
Cause: Natural language transition has empty prompt
Fix: Add condition like "User wants to speak with billing"
```

**Missing Target Node**:

```yaml
Error: 'Transition target node does not exist'
Node: Router "Account_Type"
Cause: Transition points to deleted node
Fix: Reconnect transition to valid node or delete transition
```

**No Fallback Transition** (Warning):

```yaml
Warning: 'No fallback transition found'
Node: Conversation Node "Categorize_Issue"
Cause: No Always transition
Impact: User input might not match any condition
Fix: Add Always transition as fallback
```

#### 5. Global Node Errors

**Missing Global Condition**:

```yaml
Error: 'Global trigger condition is required'
Node: Transfer Agent Node "Transfer_Agent"
Cause: isGlobal = true but globalCondition is empty
Fix: Add condition like "User wants to speak with a human agent"
```

**Extracted Variable in Global Condition**:

```yaml
Error: "Global node uses extracted variable '{{account_number}}'"
Node: Global Conversation "Account_Specific_Help"
Cause: globalCondition references extracted variable
Fix: Use only system or custom variables in global conditions
```

#### 6. Tool Override Errors

**Empty Parameter Override**:

```yaml
Error: 'All parameter override values must be filled'
Node: Tool Node "Custom_API"
Cause: Parameter override enabled but value is empty
Fix: Provide override value or disable override
```

**Empty Header Override**:

```yaml
Error: 'All header override values must be filled'
Node: Tool Node "External_Service"
Cause: HTTP header override enabled but value is empty
Fix: Provide header value or disable override
```

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Development Testing

**Test as you build**:

```yaml
After Adding Each Node: 1. Fill in all required fields
  2. Check for validation errors
  3. Test transitions logic
  4. Verify variable extraction
  5. Save snapshot

After Completing a Branch: 1. Test entire path end-to-end
  2. Try invalid inputs
  3. Test edge cases
  4. Verify error handling
  5. Save named snapshot
```

### 2. Call Testing (Test Mode)

Use the built-in call testing feature:

```yaml
Location: Header → "Test Call" button

Features:
  - Make test call to your flow
  - Real-time node highlighting (shows current node)
  - Live call logs (see AI decisions)
  - Variable inspection (view extracted variables)
  - Transition tracking (see which transitions fired)

Test Scenarios: ✓ Happy path (ideal user)
  ✓ Confused user (unclear inputs)
  ✓ Difficult user (edge case responses)
  ✓ Error scenarios (invalid data)
  ✓ Global node triggers (interrupt flow)
  ✓ DTMF inputs (keypad presses)
  ✓ Long silences (timeout behavior)
  ✓ Multiple interruptions (concurrent events)
```

### 3. Live Call Logs

Real-time debugging during test calls:

```yaml
Call Log Panel:
  Location: Right side during test call

  Shows:
    - Timestamp for each event
    - Node entered/exited
    - Transitions evaluated
    - Transition results (matched/not matched)
    - Variables extracted (name and value)
    - Tool calls (request and response)
    - LLM decisions (why transition fired)
    - Errors or warnings

  Use Cases:
    - See why a transition didn't fire
    - Verify variable extraction
    - Debug tool failures
    - Understand AI decisions
    - Track conversation flow
```

### 4. Snapshot Testing

Use snapshots for regression testing:

```yaml
Snapshot Strategy:
  1. Create "Known Good" snapshot
     - Flow works correctly
     - All tests pass
     - Named: "v1.0 - Production"

  2. Create "Development" snapshot
     - Make experimental changes
     - Named: "v1.1-dev - Testing new routing"

  3. Test development snapshot
     - Run all test scenarios
     - Compare to known good

  4. If tests pass:
     - Promote to production
     - Create new known good snapshot

  5. If tests fail:
     - Debug in dev snapshot
     - Don't affect production
     - Can rollback to known good
```

## Debugging Tools

### 1. Node Highlighting

```yaml
During Test Calls:
  - Current node: Highlighted with animated ring
  - Previous nodes: Dimmed
  - Unvisited nodes: Normal opacity

  Use To:
    - Verify conversation path
    - See which nodes were triggered
    - Identify unexpected routing
    - Confirm global node triggering
```

### 2. Variable Inspector

```yaml
Variables Panel:
  Location: Right panel during test or edit

  Shows:
    - System variables (session_id, current_time, etc.)
    - Custom variables (your API-provided vars)
    - Extracted variables (collected during conversation)

  Features:
    - Real-time updates during calls
    - Type indicators (string, number, boolean)
    - Value preview
    - Scope information (global, node-specific)

  Use To:
    - Verify variable extraction
    - Check variable values
    - Debug template rendering
    - Validate variable references
```

### 3. Transition Inspector

```yaml
Transition Details (in Call Logs):
  For each transition evaluated:
    - Transition type (NL, Equation, DTMF, Always)
    - Condition (full text)
    - Evaluation result (true/false)
    - Priority (if applicable)
    - Target node
    - Why it matched/didn't match

  Example:
    Transition: Natural Language
      Condition: "User wants to speak with billing"
      User Input: "I have a billing question"
      LLM Decision: MATCH (confidence: 0.95)
      Action: Navigate to Billing_Department node
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Transition Never Fires

**Symptoms**:

- Expected transition doesn't trigger
- Conversation stuck or goes to wrong path

**Debugging Steps**:

```yaml
1. Check Transition Priority:
   - Is there a higher priority transition that matches first?
   - Check call logs to see which transition actually fired

2. Check Transition Condition:
   Natural Language:
     - Is prompt specific enough?
     - Test with exact user phrasing
     - Check LLM evaluation in call logs

   Equation:
     - Does variable exist?
     - Is variable value what you expect?
     - Check operator (equals vs. contains)
     - Verify type matching (string vs. number)

3. Check Variable Availability:
   - Was variable extracted before this node?
   - Check Variables panel for current values
   - Verify variable name spelling

4. Check Fallback:
   - Is there an Always transition that's catching everything?
   - Is it at the right priority (lowest)?

Solution Examples:
  ❌ Priority issue:
    - Always (priority: 100) catches before Natural Language (priority: 50)
  ✅ Fix:
    - Always (priority: 0), Natural Language (priority: 100)

  ❌ Variable issue:
    - Equation: account_balance > 1000
    - But account_balance doesn't exist yet
  ✅ Fix:
    - Add existence check first, or extract variable earlier in flow
```

### Issue 2: Variable Not Extracted

**Symptoms**:

- Variable shows as undefined or null
- Template {{variable_name}} renders as empty

**Debugging Steps**:

```yaml
1. Check Extraction Configuration:
   Conversation Node:
     - Is extraction prompt clear?
     - Is description detailed enough (10+ chars)?
     - Is variable name valid (snake_case)?

   Tool Node:
     - Is JSON path correct?
     - Does tool response contain expected field?
     - Check tool call logs for actual response

2. Check User Input:
   - Did user actually provide the information?
   - Check call logs for user utterance
   - Was input clear and parseable?

3. Check LLM Extraction:
   - See call logs for extraction attempt
   - LLM might not have understood input
   - Extraction prompt might be unclear

4. Check Variable Scope:
   - Using variable before it's extracted?
   - Check flow order (extract before use)

Solution Examples:
  ❌ Vague extraction:
    Prompt: "Get the number"
    User: "My account is 12345678"
    Result: LLM doesn't know which number
  ✅ Fix:
    Prompt: "Extract the 8-digit account number the customer provides"

  ❌ Wrong JSON path:
    Path: $.accountNumber
    Response: {"data": {"account_number": "12345"}}
    Result: undefined
  ✅ Fix:
    Path: $.data.account_number
```

### Issue 3: Global Node Not Triggering

**Symptoms**:

- Say "I want an agent" but transfer doesn't happen
- DTMF press doesn't trigger global node

**Debugging Steps**:

```yaml
1. Check Global Configuration:
   - Is isGlobal = true?
   - Is globalCondition filled?
   - Is globalCondition specific enough?

2. Check Variable Usage:
   - Does globalCondition use extracted variables?
   - Only system and custom variables allowed
   - Check for validation errors

3. Check Trigger Specificity:
   Natural Language:
     - Try exact phrasing from globalCondition
     - Check if condition is too narrow
     - Check if overlapping with other global nodes

   DTMF:
     - Verify key is configured (0-9, *, #)
     - Check if DTMF is enabled globally
     - Try pressing key during conversation

4. Check Priority Conflicts:
   - Is a local transition catching input first?
   - Local transitions can override global
   - Check call logs for what matched

Solution Examples:
  ❌ Uses extracted variable:
    globalCondition: "User needs help with {{account_type}}"
    Result: Validation error
  ✅ Fix:
    globalCondition: "User wants to speak with an agent"

  ❌ Too narrow:
    globalCondition: "User says 'transfer me to an agent please'"
    Result: Only matches exact phrase
  ✅ Fix:
    globalCondition: "User wants to speak with a human agent or representative"
```

### Issue 4: Tool Call Fails

**Symptoms**:

- Tool node doesn't execute
- Error in call logs
- Flow doesn't proceed

**Debugging Steps**:

```yaml
1. Check Tool Configuration:
   - Is tool selected?
   - Are all required parameters filled?
   - Are parameter values valid?

2. Check Tool Response:
   - Look at call logs → Tool Calls tab
   - See exact request sent
   - See exact response received
   - Check for error messages

3. Check Parameter Templates:
   - Are variables in templates defined?
   - Example: "{{account_number}}" - does account_number exist?
   - Check for typos in variable names

4. Check Tool Availability:
   - Is tool still available in your account?
   - Has tool configuration changed?
   - Try tool in tool testing interface

5. Check Timeout Settings:
   - Default: 30 seconds
   - Is tool taking too long?
   - Increase timeout if needed

6. Check Error Handling:
   - What's onErrorBehavior setting?
   - continue: Flow proceeds anyway
   - retry: Retries N times
   - fail: Stops flow
   - Check which path was taken

Solution Examples:
  ❌ Undefined variable in parameter:
    Parameter: account_id = "{{account_num}}"
    Variable name: account_number (typo)
    Result: Sent as empty string
  ✅ Fix:
    Parameter: account_id = "{{account_number}}"

  ❌ Tool timeout:
    Timeout: 5000ms (5 seconds)
    Tool takes: 10 seconds
    Result: Timeout error
  ✅ Fix:
    Timeout: 15000ms (15 seconds)
```

### Issue 5: Message Not Speaking as Expected

**Symptoms**:

- Message renders incorrectly
- Variables show as {{variable_name}} instead of value
- Message skipped entirely

**Debugging Steps**:

```yaml
1. Check Message Content:
   - Is message field filled?
   - Is messageType set correctly (static vs. prompt)?
   - Check for template syntax errors

2. Check Variable Availability:
   - Were variables extracted before this node?
   - Check Variables panel for current values
   - Use fallback syntax: {{var || 'default'}}

3. Check Skip Response Setting:
   - Is skipResponse = true?
   - This silences the message
   - Intentional for silent routing

4. Check Voice Settings:
   - Is voice configured in global settings?
   - Is voice provider accessible?
   - Check for voice-related errors in logs

5. Check Message Type:
   Static:
     - Speaks message exactly as written
     - Variables are replaced

   Prompt:
     - LLM generates response based on prompt
     - Check LLM settings
     - See generated response in call logs

Solution Examples:
  ❌ Variable not available:
    Message: "Hello {{customer_name}}, your balance is {{balance}}"
    Variables: customer_name exists, balance doesn't
    Result: "Hello John, your balance is "
  ✅ Fix:
    Message: "Hello {{customer_name}}, your balance is {{balance || 'unavailable'}}"
    Result: "Hello John, your balance is unavailable"

  ❌ Unbalanced braces:
    Message: "Your balance is {{balance}"
    Result: Validation error
  ✅ Fix:
    Message: "Your balance is {{balance}}"
```

### Issue 6: Flow Performance Issues

**Symptoms**:

- Long delays between messages
- Slow transition evaluation
- Timeouts during calls

**Debugging Steps**:

```yaml
1. Check Global Node Count:
   - How many global nodes?
   - Each adds 200-800ms per user input
   - Recommended: 3-5 maximum

2. Check Natural Language Transition Count:
   - Count NL transitions per node
   - Each adds 200-800ms
   - Recommended: < 5 per node

3. Check Tool Call Efficiency:
   - Are tools called sequentially?
   - Can they be parallelized?
   - Are there redundant API calls?

4. Check LLM Settings:
   - Max tokens too high?
   - Using slower model unnecessarily?
   - Can use faster model for simple tasks?

5. Check Knowledge Base:
   - How many knowledge items?
   - Retrieval adds 200-500ms
   - Optimize chunk size and top-k

Optimization Examples:
  ❌ Slow (5 NL transitions):
    - Natural: "billing" → Billing
    - Natural: "technical" → Tech
    - Natural: "sales" → Sales
    - Natural: "support" → Support
    - Natural: "account" → Account
    Total: 5 × 500ms = 2.5 seconds

  ✅ Fast (1 NL + equations):
    - Natural: "categorize" → Category_Router
      Router:
        - Equation: category == "billing" → Billing
        - Equation: category == "technical" → Tech
        ...
    Total: 500ms (single NL evaluation)
```

Steps: 1. Check validation errors
  → Fix all red errors
  → Address warnings

  2. Test in call mode
  → Follow happy path
  → Check node highlighting

  3. Verify variables
  → Open Variables panel
  → Confirm extractions work

  4. Check transitions
  → Review call logs
  → See which transitions fired

  5. Test edge cases
  → Invalid inputs
  → Unexpected responses

  6. Iterate and improve
  → Fix issues found
  → Retest
```

### Workflow 2: Existing Flow Broke After Changes

```yaml
Steps: 1. Identify what changed
  → Check snapshot history
  → Compare to last working version

  2. Revert to last known good
  → Load previous snapshot
  → Verify it still works

  3. Reapply changes incrementally
  → One change at a time
  → Test after each change

  4. Find breaking change

Steps: 1. Reproduce the issue
  → Use test call with same inputs
  → Try to see the problem yourself

  2. Enable debug logging
  → Turn on detailed call logs
  → Make test call again

  3. Analyze call logs
  → Find where flow diverged from expected
  → Check variable values at that point
  → See which transitions evaluated

  4. Identify root cause
  → Missing validation?
  → Unexpected user input?
  → Variable not extracted?
  → Transition logic wrong?

  5. Create fix
  → Make changes in development snapshot
  → Test thoroughly

  6. Deploy fix

## Best Debugging Practices

### 1. Start Small

```yaml
✅ Test individual nodes before full flow
✅ Add complexity gradually
✅ Test after each change
✅ Save snapshots frequently

❌ Build entire flow before testing
❌ Change many things at once
❌ Hope it works in production
```

### 2. Use Descriptive Names

```yaml
✅ Names that explain purpose:
  - 'Verify_Customer_Account_Number'
  - 'Route_to_Department_by_Issue_Type'
  - 'Retry_Payment_Collection_Max_3_Attempts'

❌ Generic names:
  - 'Node 1'
  - 'Router'
  - 'Conversation'
```

### 3. Document Complex Logic

```yaml
✅ Use description fields:
  Node Description: 'This router checks if customer is VIP (tier=platinum OR lifetime_value>50000) and routes to priority support'

✅ Use transition descriptions: 'User explicitly wants to cancel (not just asking about cancellation policy)'

✅ Comment in node names: 'Account_Verification_IMPORTANT_MUST_PASS'
```

### 4. Test with Real Data

```yaml
✅ Use realistic test scenarios
✅ Test with actual customer phrases
✅ Try edge cases from real calls
✅ Test in noisy environments

❌ Only test perfect conditions
❌ Only use simple test phrases
❌ Assume users follow instructions
```

### 5. Monitor Production

```yaml
✅ Set up webhooks for call events
✅ Track outcome metrics
✅ Review failed calls
✅ Monitor transfer rates
✅ Check average call duration

❌ Deploy and forget
❌ Ignore user complaints
❌ Assume it works if no errors
```
