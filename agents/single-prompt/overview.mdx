## What is a Single Prompt Agent?

A single prompt agent uses one comprehensive prompt (called a "preamble") to define all agent behaviors. This approach is the simplest and fastest way to create a voice agent, perfect for straightforward conversational scenarios.

## When to Use Single Prompt Agents

Single prompt agents are ideal when:

- Your conversation flow is relatively linear
- You don't need complex conditional branching
- Your prompt is under 500 words
- You're using 3 or fewer custom tools/functions
- You need to build and deploy quickly

## When to Upgrade to Flow Agent

Consider upgrading to a Flow Agent when:

- Your single prompt exceeds 500 words
- You need complex decision trees with multiple paths
- You require more than 3 custom tools
- You need fine-grained control over different conversation stages
- You want visual representation of your conversation flow
- You need to reuse conversation components across agents

## Key Components

### 1. **Preamble (System Prompt)**

The core instructions that define your agent's behavior, personality, task, and guidelines. This is where you tell the agent:

- Who it is (identity)
- How to behave (style and tone)
- What to do (tasks and goals)
- What not to do (guardrails and limitations)

### 2. **Greeting Message**

The first thing your agent says when a call starts. Can be:

- **Static**: A fixed greeting message
- **Prompt-based**: Dynamically generated based on context

### 3. **Global Settings**

Configuration applied to all conversations:

- Voice and language selection
- LLM model and parameters
- Response timing and interruption handling
- Call behavior settings

### 4. **Knowledge Base** (Optional)

Upload documents, web content, or custom text that your agent can reference during conversations.

### 5. **Tools** (Optional)

Integrate custom functions, web APIs, or MCP tools to extend your agent's capabilities.

### 6. **Variables & Parameters** (Optional)

Define structured data that your agent should collect during calls, with optional outcome schema for structured responses.

## Setup Process

Creating a single prompt agent follows three main steps:

### Step 1: Write the Prompt

- Define agent identity and personality
- Set style guardrails and conversation tone
- Specify response guidelines
- Outline tasks and procedures

**[→ Learn More: Writing a Single Prompt](./write-prompt)**

### Step 2: Configure Basic Settings

- Select voice and language
- Configure call behavior (interruptions, delays, timeouts)
- Set up noise cancellation and audio processing
- Enable advanced features (gender detection, smart call end, etc.)

**[→ Learn More: Configure Basic Settings](./configure-settings)**

### Step 3: Add Integrations (Optional)

- Connect knowledge bases
- Add custom tools and functions
- Configure webhooks
- Define outcome parameters

## Example Use Cases

### Customer Support Bot

Simple Q&A agent that answers common questions using knowledge base:

- **Preamble**: ~200 words defining personality and guidelines
- **Knowledge Base**: FAQ documents and help articles
- **Tools**: None or minimal (ticket creation)

### Appointment Scheduler

Collects information and books appointments:

- **Preamble**: ~300 words with booking procedure
- **Tools**: Calendar availability check, booking function
- **Variables**: Name, phone, date, time, service type

### Lead Qualification

Gathers lead information and routes to sales:

- **Preamble**: ~250 words with qualification questions
- **Variables**: Company size, budget, timeline, needs
- **Outcome**: Structured lead data

## Key Features

### Flexible Greeting

Choose between static greetings for consistency or dynamic greetings that adapt to context (time of day, caller information, etc.).

### Advanced Call Settings

- **Response Delay**: Control how quickly the agent responds (100-1500ms)
- **Interruption Handling**: Allow or prevent user interruptions
- **Inactivity Timeout**: Automatically handle silent callers (5-30 seconds)
- **Max Call Duration**: Set maximum call length (30-600 seconds)

### Audio Processing

- **Noise Cancellation**: Remove background noise (disabled, per sentence, or per conversation)
- **Background Noise**: Add ambient sound for realism
- **Thinking Voice**: Add natural pauses and filler words

### Intelligence Features

- **Gender Detection**: Detect caller gender for personalized responses
- **Smart Call End**: Automatically end calls when conversation concludes
- **Language Dialect Switcher**: Adapt to caller's dialect
- **Speaker Identification**: Identify different speakers on the same call
- **Agentic RAG**: Advanced knowledge retrieval with reasoning

## Benefits

### ✅ Quick to Build

Get started in minutes with a single comprehensive prompt.

### ✅ Easy to Maintain

All agent behavior defined in one place makes updates simple.

### ✅ Cost-Effective

Simpler architecture means lower latency and potentially lower costs.

### ✅ Perfect for MVPs

Fastest path from idea to working agent.

## Limitations

### ⚠️ Limited Complexity

Not suitable for highly branching conversation flows.

### ⚠️ Prompt Size Constraints

Large prompts (>500 words) become harder to manage and may reduce performance.

### ⚠️ Less Control

Cannot fine-tune behavior for specific conversation stages independently.

### ⚠️ Tool Limitations

Best with 3 or fewer tools; more tools can confuse the agent.

## Template Structure

Here's a recommended prompt structure:

```
## Identity
[Define who the agent is and what it represents]

## Style Guardrails
[Set tone, personality, and conversation style]

## Response Guidelines
[Specify how to format responses and handle edge cases]

## Task & Goals
[Outline what the agent should accomplish]

## Objection Handling
[Provide guidance for common objections or difficult scenarios]
```
