description: 'Configure response timing, interruptions, timeouts, and call duration controls for optimal conversation flow'
---

## Overview

Call behavior settings control the timing, flow, and interaction dynamics of your voice agent conversations. These settings directly impact caller experience, conversation efficiency, and perceived naturalness of your AI agent.

<Info>
**Key Call Behavior Settings:**
- Response delay (how quickly agent responds)
- Interruption handling (can users interrupt?)
- User inactivity timeout (handling silent callers)
- Max call duration (preventing runaway calls)
- Background ambient sound
- Thinking voice (natural pauses)
</Info>

## Response Delay

### What is Response Delay?

Response delay determines how long the agent waits after detecting that the user has stopped speaking before generating a response.

**Technical Definition:**
The minimum number of milliseconds between when the system detects speech has ended and when it begins processing the response.

### Configuration

**Range:** 100ms - 1500ms
**Default:** 400ms
**Increment:** 100ms

**To configure:**

1. Open **Call Settings** section
2. Locate **Response Delay** slider
3. Adjust value (shows in milliseconds)
4. Current value displays next to slider
5. Save changes

### Impact on Conversation Flow

**Lower Values (100-300ms):**

✅ **Advantages:**

- Very responsive, snappy conversations
- Feels more dynamic and engaging
- Efficient for simple Q&A
- Better for impatient callers

⚠️ **Disadvantages:**

- May cut off users who pause naturally
- Can interrupt multi-part questions
- Feels rushed for some users
- May miss end of long answers

**Medium Values (400-600ms):**

✅ **Advantages:**

- Balanced, natural conversation pace
- Allows brief pauses without cutting off
- Works for most use cases
- Professional feel

⚠️ **Disadvantages:**

- May feel slightly slow for rapid exchanges
- Not ideal for very simple interactions

**Higher Values (700-1500ms):**

✅ **Advantages:**

- Very thoughtful, deliberate responses
- Great for users who speak slowly or pause
- Better for complex topics requiring thought
- Comfortable for elderly or non-native speakers

⚠️ **Disadvantages:**

- Can feel slow or unresponsive
- Inefficient for simple questions
- May frustrate fast-paced callers

<Tip>
Start with the default 400ms. Adjust based on testing with your actual target audience and use case.
</Tip>

### Response Delay by Use Case

**Customer Support (Quick Inquiries)**

- **Recommended:** 300-400ms
- **Reasoning:** Efficiency matters, questions are usually straightforward
- **Example:** "What are your hours?" → Quick response expected

**Technical Support (Complex Troubleshooting)**

- **Recommended:** 500-700ms
- **Reasoning:** Users need time to describe issues, check things
- **Example:** "My device shows error X when I..." → User may pause to read error

**Sales Calls**

- **Recommended:** 300-500ms
- **Reasoning:** Dynamic conversation, but allow for objection handling
- **Example:** Balance between energy and letting prospects speak

**Healthcare/Medical Scheduling**

- **Recommended:** 600-800ms
- **Reasoning:** Callers may be elderly, anxious, or need time to find information
- **Example:** "Let me find my insurance card..." → Needs patience

**Surveys/Feedback Collection**

- **Recommended:** 700-1000ms
- **Reasoning:** People need time to think about answers
- **Example:** "On a scale of 1-10..." → Requires contemplation

**Appointment Booking**

- **Recommended:** 400-600ms
- **Reasoning:** Moderate pace for checking calendars
- **Example:** "Let me check my calendar..." → Brief pause acceptable

**Legal/Compliance Information**

- **Recommended:** 600-900ms
- **Reasoning:** Complex information, users may need to take notes
- **Example:** Delivering important terms → Don't rush

### Testing Response Delay

**Test Scenarios:**

1. **Natural Pausers:** Have someone who pauses mid-sentence test
2. **Fast Talkers:** Have rapid speakers test for cut-offs
3. **Question Sequences:** "I have two questions..." (does it wait?)
4. **Listing Items:** "I need help with X, Y, and Z" (catches all three?)
5. **Thinking Out Loud:** "So I'm wondering..." (patient enough?)

<Warning>
Response delay is highly subjective. What feels natural to you may feel slow or fast to your callers. Always test with real users from your target demographic.
</Warning>

## Interruption Handling

### What is Interruption?

Interruption handling determines whether users can speak while the agent is speaking, cutting off the agent's response.

**Enabled (Default):** Users can interrupt the agent naturally
**Disabled:** Agent completes full response before listening again

### Configuration

**To enable/disable:**

1. Open **Call Settings** section
2. Find **Interrupt** toggle
3. Toggle on (enabled) or off (disabled)
4. Save changes

### When Interruptions are Enabled

**Behavior:**

- Agent speaks response
- User starts speaking
- Agent immediately stops and listens
- Agent acknowledges interruption (optional)
- User completes their input
- Agent responds to new input

**Example Flow:**

```
Agent: "Our business hours are Monday through Friday, 9 AM to—"
User: "Actually, I need weekend hours"
Agent: [stops speaking] "For weekend hours, we're open Saturday..."
```

✅ **Best For:**

- Customer service conversations
- Sales calls (engagement is key)
- Support where users may have urgent questions
- Natural, human-like conversations
- Interactive Q&A sessions

✅ **Advantages:**

- Natural conversation flow
- Users don't have to wait for full response
- Better for correcting misunderstandings
- More engaging experience

⚠️ **Considerations:**

- Agent may be cut off before delivering full message
- Important information could be missed
- May be interrupted by background noise

### When Interruptions are Disabled

**Behavior:**

- Agent speaks complete response
- User speaking during this time is ignored
- After agent finishes, system listens for user input
- User must wait for agent to complete

**Example Flow:**

```
Agent: "Our business hours are Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 6 PM,
       and Saturday 10 AM to 4 PM. We're closed on Sundays."
User: [tries to speak but agent continues]
Agent: [finishes complete response]
System: [now listening for user input]
User: "What about holidays?"
```

✅ **Best For:**

- Critical information delivery
- Legal disclaimers
- Compliance statements
- Step-by-step instructions
- Confirmation of important actions
- Medical information
- Safety warnings

✅ **Advantages:**

- Ensures complete information delivery
- No partial messages
- Better for structured scripts
- Clearer for complex multi-step instructions

⚠️ **Considerations:**

- Feels less natural
- Frustrating if agent is verbose
- Users may want to interject
- Less engaging conversation

<Note>
You can disable interrupts globally but still allow them for specific situations in your prompt. Example: "Users cannot interrupt normally, but if they say 'stop' or 'wait', acknowledge immediately."
</Note>

### Mixed Approach (Prompt-Based)

Even with interrupts enabled, you can guide behavior in your prompt:

```markdown
# Interruption Handling

Allow users to interrupt naturally during normal conversation.

However, for critical information, say:
"Let me share some important information - I'll need about 30 seconds."

Then deliver the critical information. Users are less likely to interrupt
when they know it's important and time-bounded.
```

### Interruption Handling by Use Case

| Use Case            | Recommendation | Reasoning                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Customer Support    | **Enabled**    | Natural conversation, user needs matter most      |
| Sales Calls         | **Enabled**    | Engagement is critical, handle objections quickly |
| Technical Support   | **Enabled**    | User may need to clarify or correct               |
| Appointment Booking | **Enabled**    | User may realize conflict mid-confirmation        |
| Surveys             | **Disabled**   | Complete each question clearly                    |
| Legal/Compliance    | **Disabled**   | Must deliver full disclaimers                     |
| Medical Information | **Disabled**   | Critical safety information                       |
| IVR Menu            | **Disabled**   | User needs to hear all options                    |
| Announcements       | **Disabled**   | Important broadcast information                   |
| Emergency Alerts    | **Disabled**   | Critical instructions must be heard               |

<Tip>
For most conversational agents, keep interrupts **enabled** for a natural experience. Only disable for specific compliance or information delivery scenarios.
</Tip>

## User Inactivity Timeout

### What is Inactivity Timeout?

The number of seconds of silence before the agent proactively reaches out to check if the user is still there.

**Purpose:** Handle situations where:

- User stepped away
- User is confused or doesn't know what to say
- Connection issues
- User is multitasking (looking for information)

### Configuration

**Range:** 5-30 seconds
**Default:** 15 seconds
**Increment:** 1 second

**To configure:**

1. Open **Call Settings** section
2. Locate **User Inactivity Timeout** slider
3. Adjust value (shows in seconds)
4. Save changes

### How It Works

**Flow:**

1. User stops speaking
2. Agent responds (if applicable)
3. Silence begins
4. After [timeout] seconds of silence:

   - Agent proactively asks if user is still there
   - "Are you still there?"
   - "Is there anything else I can help with?"
   - "I'm here whenever you're ready."

5. If user responds: Continue conversation
6. If still silent: Repeat or end call (configurable in prompt)

### Timeout Duration Guidelines

**Short Timeouts (5-10 seconds):**

✅ **Good For:**

- High-volume call centers
- Simple transactional interactions
- Efficient, quick exchanges
- Queue management scenarios

⚠️ **Watch Out:**

- May feel rushed
- Not enough time to look up information
- Frustrating for multi-tasking users

**Medium Timeouts (15-20 seconds):**

✅ **Good For:**

- General customer service
- Balanced approach
- Most business use cases
- Default recommendation

⚠️ **Watch Out:**

- May be too long for simple interactions
- May be too short for complex lookups

**Long Timeouts (25-30 seconds):**

✅ **Good For:**

- Complex information gathering (user checking documents)
- Elderly or deliberate callers
- Healthcare/medical (finding insurance cards)
- Technical support (checking error messages)

⚠️ **Watch Out:**

- Very long silence can feel awkward
- Inefficient for simple calls
- May indicate dropped connection

<Warning>
Don't set timeout too short (&lt;10s) unless you have a specific reason. Users often need time to check calendars, find information, or think about responses.
</Warning>

### Inactivity Timeout by Use Case

**Customer Support (General)**

- **Recommended:** 15-20 seconds
- **Reasoning:** Balanced patience, not too rushed
- **Poke Message:** "I'm still here if you need anything else."

**Technical Support**

- **Recommended:** 20-30 seconds
- **Reasoning:** Users may be checking error messages, cables, settings
- **Poke Message:** "Take your time. Let me know when you're ready."

**Appointment Booking**

- **Recommended:** 15-25 seconds
- **Reasoning:** Users checking calendars
- **Poke Message:** "I'll wait while you check your schedule."

**Sales/Lead Qualification**

- **Recommended:** 10-15 seconds
- **Reasoning:** Keep momentum, but allow thinking
- **Poke Message:** "Do you have any questions I can answer?"

**Surveys**

- **Recommended:** 20-30 seconds
- **Reasoning:** People need time to think about ratings/feedback
- **Poke Message:** "Take your time to think about your answer."

**Quick Info Lookup**

- **Recommended:** 5-10 seconds
- **Reasoning:** Simple questions, quick answers
- **Poke Message:** "Is there anything else you need?"

### Customizing Poke Messages

Define how your agent handles silence in your prompt:

```markdown
# Handling Silence

After 15 seconds of silence:
First time: "I'm still here. Take your time if you're looking something up."
Still silent: "No rush! I'm here whenever you're ready."
Extended silence (30s+): "I'll let you go for now. Feel free to call back anytime!"

Then end the call gracefully.
```

**Poke Message Best Practices:**

- Be reassuring, not demanding
- Acknowledge they may be busy ("looking something up")
- Offer to wait or call back
- Don't make user feel bad about silence

<Tip>
Use the `pokeMessages` array in your configuration to define multiple poke messages. The system will use them in sequence for repeated silence periods.
</Tip>

## Max Call Duration

### What is Max Call Duration?

The maximum length of time (in seconds) a call can last before being automatically terminated.

**Purpose:**

- Prevent runaway costs
- Handle stuck calls
- Set clear boundaries
- Protect against infinite loops

### Configuration

**Range:** 30-600 seconds (0.5 - 10 minutes)
**Default:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)
**Increment:** 10 seconds

**To configure:**

1. Open **Call Settings** section
2. Locate **Max Call Duration** slider
3. Adjust value (shows in seconds)
4. Save changes

### How It Works

**Flow:**

1. Call begins
2. Timer starts
3. At [max duration - 30s]: Agent warns (optional via prompt)
   - "We have about 30 seconds left. Is there anything else?"
4. At [max duration]: Call ends with farewell message
5. Call terminates gracefully

<Info>
Max call duration is a safety net, not a target. Most calls should end naturally via Smart Call End or user ending the conversation.
</Info>

### Duration Guidelines by Use Case

**Quick Transactions (30-120 seconds)**

- **Use Cases:** Balance check, hours lookup, simple FAQ
- **Why:** Simple information, in and out
- **Example:** "What are your hours?" → 45 second call

**Standard Conversations (120-300 seconds)**

- **Use Cases:** Customer support, appointment booking, basic troubleshooting
- **Why:** Moderate complexity, multiple steps
- **Example:** Schedule appointment → 2-3 minute call

**Extended Support (300-600 seconds)**

- **Use Cases:** Technical troubleshooting, detailed sales, consultations
- **Why:** Complex issues require time
- **Example:** Troubleshoot device → 5-7 minute call

**Surveys/Feedback (120-240 seconds)**

- **Use Cases:** Customer satisfaction surveys, feedback collection
- **Why:** Multiple questions, time to think
- **Example:** 10-question survey → 3-4 minutes

<Warning>
Setting max duration too low creates poor user experience. Set it 20-30% higher than your expected average call duration to allow for edge cases.
</Warning>

### Max Duration Recommendations

| Use Case             | Recommended Max | Average Expected | Buffer |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------ |
| Balance/Hours Check  | 60s             | 30-40s           | 2x     |
| Simple FAQ           | 90s             | 45-60s           | 1.5x   |
| Appointment Booking  | 240s            | 120-180s         | 1.3x   |
| Customer Support     | 360s            | 180-240s         | 1.5x   |
| Technical Support    | 480s            | 240-360s         | 1.3x   |
| Sales Qualification  | 300s            | 180-240s         | 1.3x   |
| Detailed Survey      | 300s            | 180-240s         | 1.3x   |
| Complex Consultation | 600s            | 360-480s         | 1.3x   |

### Handling Max Duration in Prompts

Prepare for approaching time limit:

```markdown
# Max Call Duration Handling

The system will notify you when 60 seconds remain.

At that point:
"I want to make sure I help you before our time is up. What's the most
important thing I can help you with right now?"

If user has additional needs:
"I can schedule a callback or transfer you to someone who can continue
helping you. Which would you prefer?"

At max duration:
"I need to wrap up our call now. Here's a summary of what we covered: [brief summary]
Thank you for calling!"
```

<Tip>
Always provide a graceful exit before max duration. Users shouldn't feel abruptly cut off.
</Tip>

### Monitoring Call Duration

Use analytics to optimize max duration:

**Metrics to track:**

- Average call duration
- % of calls hitting max duration
- Completion rate vs. duration
- User satisfaction vs. duration

**Optimization:**

- If &gt;5% of calls hit max: Increase limit
- If average is &lt;50% of max: Consider decreasing for efficiency
- If abandonment increases near max: Add warning prompts

## Background Noise (Ambient Sound)

### What is Background Noise?

Adds subtle ambient sound to the agent's audio to create a more human, realistic environment.

**Purpose:**

- Reduce "dead air" feeling
- Simulate call center environment
- Make AI feel more human
- Provide auditory continuity

### Configuration

**Options:**

- **Disabled (Default):** Pure AI voice, no background
- **Enabled:** Subtle background ambiance

**To enable:**

1. Open **Call Settings** section
2. Find **Ambient Sound** toggle
3. Enable or disable
4. Save changes

### When to Use Background Noise

✅ **Good Use Cases:**

**Call Center Simulation**

- Agent positioned as call center representative
- Simulates realistic environment
- Reduces AI "uncanny valley"

**Brand Consistency**

- Match existing IVR or call center sound
- Consistent experience across channels

**Reducing Dead Air**

- Some users find complete silence uncomfortable
- Gentle background provides continuity

⚠️ **Avoid Background Noise When:**

**Professional/Premium Brands**

- High-end brands may want "perfect" audio
- Background noise can seem cheap

**Technical Clarity Required**

- Medical information
- Legal disclaimers
- Complex instructions

**Using Noise Cancellation**

- Creates processing artifacts
- Conflicts with noise removal

**International Calls**

- Poor connections already have noise
- Adding more degrades quality

<Warning>
Do not enable both Background Noise and Noise Cancellation. They conflict and create audio artifacts.
</Warning>

### Background Noise Characteristics

**Sound Type:**

- Subtle office ambiance
- Very low volume (not distracting)
- Consistent throughout call
- No specific identifiable sounds

**Volume:**

- Mixed at -30dB to -40dB below voice
- Barely noticeable but present
- Never interferes with speech clarity

<Note>
Background noise is subtle by design. If you can clearly hear it, it's too loud. It should be almost subliminal.
</Note>

## Thinking Voice

### What is Thinking Voice?

Adds natural pauses and verbal fillers to make the agent sound more human and thoughtful.

**Examples:**

- "Hmm..."
- "Let me see..."
- "Okay..."
- "Ah, yes..."
- Natural pauses before responses

### Configuration

**Options:**

- **Disabled (Default):** Direct, efficient responses
- **Enabled:** Natural pauses and fillers

**To enable:**

1. Open **Call Settings** section
2. Find **Thinking Voice** toggle
3. Enable or disable
4. Save changes

### How Thinking Voice Works

**Without Thinking Voice:**

```
User: "What are your hours?"
Agent: [immediate] "We're open Monday through Friday 9 AM to 6 PM."
```

**With Thinking Voice:**

```
User: "What are your hours?"
Agent: [brief pause] "Let me check that for you...
       We're open Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 6 PM."
```

### Benefits of Thinking Voice

✅ **Advantages:**

**More Human-Like**

- Mimics natural human behavior
- People pause before answering
- Reduces "AI" feeling

**Gives Processing Time**

- Makes latency feel intentional
- Covers technical delays gracefully
- Users more patient when agent "thinks"

**Better Conversation Flow**

- Natural transitions between topics
- Less jarring subject changes
- Feels more thoughtful

**Reduces Pressure**

- Users don't feel rushed
- Comfortable pauses in conversation
- Time to process information

⚠️ **Disadvantages:**

**Slower Conversations**

- Adds 1-3 seconds per response
- Less efficient
- Longer call durations

**May Seem Less Professional**

- Some contexts demand crisp responses
- Can seem uncertain or hesitant
- May reduce authority perception

**Not Suitable for All Use Cases**

- Technical information delivery
- Time-sensitive scenarios
- High-volume quick transactions

### Thinking Voice by Use Case

| Use Case                  | Recommendation  | Reasoning                   |

| Legal Information         | ❌ **Disabled** | Authority and confidence    |
| Surveys                   | ✅ **Enabled**  | Casual, comfortable         |
| Emergency/Urgent          | ❌ **Disabled** | Direct, immediate           |
| Appointment Reminders     | ❌ **Disabled** | Clear, concise              |
| Lead Qualification        | ✅ **Enabled**  | Conversational discovery    |

<Tip>
Enable Thinking Voice for conversational, relationship-focused interactions. Disable for professional, information-delivery scenarios.
</Tip>

2. Wait for inactivity timeout
3. Verify poke message triggers
4. Verify handling of continued silence

**Scenario 3: Long Call Test**

1. Engage in conversation
2. Approach max duration
3. Verify warning (if configured)
4. Verify graceful end at max duration

**Scenario 4: Response Timing Test**

1. Ask questions with different natural pauses
2. Check for premature responses
3. Check for awkwardly long waits
4. Adjust response delay accordingly

**Scenario 5: Multi-Part Question Test**

1. Ask: "I have two questions about X and Y"
2. Verify agent waits for complete question
3. Verify agent addresses both parts

### Measuring Success

**Key Metrics:**

**Completion Rate**

- % of calls where task is completed
- Higher = better configuration

**Average Call Duration**

- Should match expected duration for use case
- Too long = inefficient
- Too short = rushed/incomplete

**Abandonment Rate**

- % of callers who hang up mid-call
- High abandonment may indicate poor timing

**User Satisfaction**

- Post-call surveys
- Feedback on conversation flow
- Natural vs. robotic feel

**Repeat Questions**

- If users frequently repeat themselves
- May indicate response delay too short

<Tip>
Track these metrics in your analytics dashboard and adjust settings based on real data, not assumptions.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Agent Cuts Off Users Mid-Sentence

**Problem:** Agent responds before user finishes speaking

**Solution:**

- Increase Response Delay (+100-200ms)
- Test with users who speak slowly or pause
- Verify no echo/feedback creating false endpoints

### Agent Feels Unresponsive

**Problem:** Long pauses after user speaks

**Solution:**

- Decrease Response Delay (-100-200ms)
- Check LLM latency (may be model issue)
- Verify adequate server resources

### Users Complain About Being Rushed

**Problem:** Not enough time to think or respond

**Solution:**

- Increase Inactivity Timeout (+5-10s)
- Enable Thinking Voice for more natural pace
- Increase Response Delay slightly

### Calls Frequently Hit Max Duration

**Problem:** >5% of calls reaching time limit

**Solution:**

- Increase Max Call Duration (+60-120s)
- Review if agent is too verbose
- Check for conversation loops

### Users Interrupt Constantly

**Problem:** Frequent interruptions disrupting flow

**Solution:**

- Shorten agent responses in prompt
- Keep responses to 20-30 seconds max
- Use "Let me share important info" for critical sections

### Poke Messages Feel Annoying

**Problem:** Users react negatively to timeout prompts

**Solution:**

- Increase Inactivity Timeout
- Soften poke message language
- Reduce frequency of repeat pokes
