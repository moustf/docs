---

After writing your prompt, configure the basic settings that control how your agent sounds, behaves, and interacts with callers.

## Voice & Language Settings

### Voice Selection

Choose the voice that will represent your AI during conversations.

**How to configure:**

1. Navigate to the "Voice Settings" section
2. Click the voice dropdown
3. Browse available voices by:
   - **Provider**: Deepgram, ElevenLabs, PlayHT, etc.
   - **Language**: Filter by target language
   - **Gender**: Male, female, or neutral voices
4. Preview voices before selecting

**Best Practices:**

- Match voice to your brand personality
- Consider your target audience demographics
- Test voice with actual prompts, not just previews
- Ensure voice supports your selected language/dialect

### Language & Dialect

Select the primary language for interactions.

**Available Options:**

- Language selection with full locale support
- Dialect-specific options (e.g., US English, UK English, Mexican Spanish)
- Automatic language detection (optional)

**Language Dialect Switcher:**
Enable this to automatically adapt to the caller's specific dialect within the same language.

**Use case:** A caller from Scotland speaking English would be better understood with UK English model vs US English.

## Call Behavior Settings

### Response Delay

Control how quickly the agent responds after the user stops speaking.

**Range:** 100ms - 1500ms
**Default:** 400ms

**Lower values (100-300ms):**

- More responsive, faster-paced conversations
- Better for customer service, sales
- Risk: May interrupt users who pause naturally

**Higher values (600-1500ms):**

- More thoughtful, deliberate responses
- Better for elderly callers, complex topics
- Risk: May feel slow or unresponsive

**Formula:** Each 100ms adjustment changes perceived responsiveness significantly.

**Recommendation:** Start with 400ms, adjust based on testing.

### Interruption Handling

Choose whether users can interrupt the agent while speaking.

**Options:**

- **Enabled (default)**: Users can interrupt naturally, like human conversation
- **Disabled**: Agent completes full response before listening again

**When to disable:**

- Critical information that must be heard completely
- Legal disclaimers or compliance statements
- Multi-step instructions
- Confirmation of important actions

**When to enable:**

- Natural customer support conversations
- Sales calls where engagement is key
- Interactive Q&A sessions

### User Inactivity Timeout

Automatically handle callers who don't respond.

**Range:** 5-30 seconds
**Default:** 15 seconds

**What happens:** After silence, agent will:

1. Prompt user ("Are you still there?")
2. If still no response, either end call or transfer (configurable)

**Shorter timeouts (5-10s):**

- Tighter, more efficient conversations
- Better for high-volume scenarios

**Longer timeouts (20-30s):**

- More patient with users who need time to think
- Better for complex topics or elderly users

### Max Call Duration

Set maximum call length to prevent runaway costs.

**Range:** 30-600 seconds
**Default:** 300 seconds (5 minutes)

**What happens:** Call automatically ends after maximum duration, with optional farewell message.

**Recommendations:**

- **Customer support:** 300-600 seconds
- **Lead qualification:** 180-300 seconds
- **Appointment booking:** 120-240 seconds
- **Surveys:** 120-180 seconds

## Audio Processing Settings

### Noise Cancellation

Remove background noise from caller's audio.

**Options:**

- **Disabled**: No noise cancellation (lowest latency)
- **Per Sentence**: Processes each sentence separately (balanced)
- **Per Conversation**: Processes entire conversation (highest quality)

**Latency Impact:**

- Disabled: 0ms
- Per Sentence: ~50-100ms
- Per Conversation: ~100-200ms

**When to use:**

- **Disabled**: Quiet environments, latency-critical applications
- **Per Sentence**: General use, balanced quality and performance
- **Per Conversation**: Noisy environments, quality over speed

### Background Noise

Add ambient sound to make agent feel more human.

**Use cases:**

- Call center ambiance for authenticity
- White noise to avoid "dead air" feeling
- Environmental sounds for context (office, store, etc.)

**Options:**

- **Disabled (default)**: Pure AI voice, no background
- **Enabled**: Subtle background ambiance

**Note:** Don't combine with noise cancellation—creates processing artifacts.

### Thinking Voice

Add natural pauses and filler words for human-like conversation.

**When enabled, agent may use:**

- "Hmm..."
- "Let me see..."
- "Ah, okay..."
- Natural pauses before responses

**Benefits:**

- More natural, human-like interaction
- Gives users time to process information
- Less jarring during transitions

**Drawbacks:**

- Slightly longer conversations
- May seem less professional in some contexts

**Best for:** Customer support, friendly conversations
**Avoid for:** Professional/corporate settings, compliance calls

## Intelligence Features

### Gender Detection

Automatically detect caller's gender for personalized responses.

**How it works:** Analyzes voice characteristics to determine likely gender.

**Use cases:**

- Personalized greetings ("Yes sir" vs "Yes ma'am")
- Tailored product recommendations
- Culturally appropriate responses

**Access in prompts:** Use the `{{user_gender}}` variable

**Privacy note:** Ensure compliance with local regulations regarding automated gender detection.

### Smart Call End

Automatically end calls when conversation naturally concludes.

**How it works:** LLM detects when:

- User says goodbye or farewell
- Conversation objectives completed
- User indicates they're done

**Benefits:**

- Cleaner call endings
- Better user experience
- Reduced call duration costs

**Note:** Combines with max call duration as a safety net.

### Speaker Identification

Identify different speakers on the same call.

**Use cases:**

- Speakerphone calls with multiple people
- Conference calls
- Household calls where multiple people may speak

**Access in prompts:** System tracks which speaker said what in conversation history.

**Limitations:** Requires distinct voice characteristics to differentiate speakers.

### Agentic RAG

Advanced knowledge retrieval with reasoning.

**Standard RAG:** Retrieves relevant documents, passes to LLM
**Agentic RAG:** LLM reasons about what information is needed, retrieves iteratively, synthesizes answer

**Benefits:**

- More accurate answers to complex questions
- Better handling of multi-step reasoning
- Improved context understanding

**Drawbacks:**

- Higher latency (additional LLM calls)
- Increased costs
- Requires well-structured knowledge base

**Best for:** Complex technical support, detailed product information, multi-faceted questions

## Tool Settings

### Gender Detection (Tool)

Enable gender detection as a callable tool (different from automatic feature).

**When to use:** When you want explicit control over when gender is detected, not automatic.

### Smart Call End (Tool)

Enable smart call end as a tool the agent can invoke.

**Difference from setting:** Agent decides when to end call based on prompt instructions, rather than automatic detection.
