## Troubleshooting Voice Issues

### Voice Sounds Robotic or Unnatural

**Possible Causes:**

- Low-quality voice selected
- Voice-text mismatch (Arabic voice speaking English)
- Technical issues with provider

**Solutions:**

1. Try a different voice from same provider
2. Test voices from different providers
3. Verify language matches voice language
4. Check for provider outages in Live Call Logs

### Voice is Too Fast or Too Slow

**Solution:**
Voice speed is inherent to each voice selection. To adjust:

1. Try a different voice with your preferred pace
2. Adjust your prompt to use shorter/longer sentences
3. For custom voices, re-clone with different sample audio pace

<Note>
Voice speed/stability parameters are currently tied to voice selection. Future updates may include speed adjustment controls.
</Note>

### Voice Doesn't Match Accent/Dialect Needed

**Solution:**

1. Use **Dialect Filter** to find exact match
2. If no exact match, choose closest available
3. Consider custom voice cloning for specific accents
4. Enable **Language Dialect Switcher** for better caller understanding

### Voice Sounds Different in Production vs Preview

**Possible Causes:**

- Preview audio is compressed
- Actual synthesis uses different parameters
- Network/audio quality differences

**Solution:**

1. Always test via **Test Agent** feature (browser call or phone)
2. Don't rely solely on preview audio
3. Test in production-like environment

### Can't Find Previously Used Voice

**Solutions:**

1. Check **Currently Used** tab

## LLM Temperature & Model Settings

While not directly voice settings, LLM configuration affects speech patterns:

### Temperature

Temperature controls response creativity and variability:

**Range:** 0.0 - 1.0
**Default:** 0.2

**Low Temperature (0.0 - 0.3):**

- More consistent, predictable responses
- Follows script/guidelines closely
- Less creative variation
- **Best for:** Customer support, information delivery, compliance

**Medium Temperature (0.4 - 0.7):**

- Balanced creativity and consistency
- Natural variation in phrasing
- Maintains guidelines while sounding natural
- **Best for:** Sales, conversational agents

**High Temperature (0.8 - 1.0):**

- More creative, varied responses
- May deviate from script
- More human-like unpredictability
- **Best for:** Creative conversations, less structured interactions

<Warning>
GPT-5 family models require temperature = 1.0 (fixed). This is automatically enforced.
</Warning>

**To adjust temperature:**

1. Open **LLM Configuration** section
2. Adjust **Temperature** slider
3. Save changes

### LLM Model Selection

The LLM model affects response quality, speed, and voice-text alignment:

**Available Models:**

- **GPT-5 Series** - Most advanced, temperature fixed at 1.0
- **GPT-4.1 Series** - Balanced quality and speed
- **Gemini Series** - Google's models
- **DeepMyst Optimized** - Telephony-optimized models

<Tip>
DeepMyst optimized models are specifically tuned for voice conversations and may provide better results than standard models.
</Tip>

**[→ Learn More: LLM Configuration](/features/llm-configuration)**

## Voice + Prompt Synergy

Your voice selection and prompt should work together:

### Matching Voice to Prompt Personality

**If your prompt says "friendly and casual":**

- ✓ Select conversational, warm voice
- ✗ Don't select formal narrator voice

**If your prompt says "professional and authoritative":**

- ✓ Select professional narrator or business voice
- ✗ Don't select casual, youthful voice

**If your prompt says "empathetic and caring":**

- ✓ Select warm, slower-paced voice
- ✗ Don't select fast, transactional voice

### Voice Affects Perceived Personality

Even with identical prompts, different voices create different perceptions:

**Professional Female Voice:**

- Perceived as helpful, organized
- Good for: Healthcare, education, customer service

**Professional Male Voice:**

- Perceived as authoritative, knowledgeable
- Good for: Finance, legal, technical support

**Casual Female Voice:**

- Perceived as friendly, approachable
- Good for: Retail, hospitality, lifestyle

**Casual Male Voice:**

- Perceived as confident, casual
- Good for: Sales, tech support, informal services

<Note>
These are generalizations based on common perceptions, not universal truths. Always test with your specific audience.
</Note>

## Multi-Language Scenarios

### Single Language Agents

Most agents operate in a single language:

1. Select language: English or Arabic
2. Choose voice in that language
3. Write prompt in that language
4. System messages appear in that language

Simple and straightforward.

### Bilingual Callers

For callers who might speak either language:

**Option 1: Separate Agents**

- Create one English agent
- Create one Arabic agent
- Route calls based on caller's language preference

**Option 2: Language Dialect Switcher**

- Configure agent in primary language
- Enable **Language Dialect Switcher**
- Agent adapts to caller's dialect within same language family

<Warning>
Single Prompt Agents cannot switch between entirely different languages (English ↔ Arabic) mid-call. For true multilingual support, create separate agents or use Flow Agent with language detection.
</Warning>

## Voice Selection Checklist

Before finalizing your voice selection, verify:

- [ ] **Language matches** - Voice language = agent language
- [ ] **Dialect is appropriate** - Matches target market if applicable
- [ ] **Gender fits brand** - Tested with target audience
- [ ] **Style matches use case** - Conversational vs Narrator
- [ ] **Tone aligns with prompt** - Voice personality matches written personality
- [ ] **Tested in real calls** - Used Test Agent feature, not just preview
- [ ] **Clear audio quality** - No distortion, artifacts, or robotic sound
- [ ] **Pace is appropriate** - Not too fast or slow for use case
- [ ] **Team approval** - Stakeholders reviewed and approved
- [ ] **A/B tested** - If high-volume, compared 2-3 options

<Tip>
Use this checklist before launching your agent to production. Voice is often the first impression callers have of your brand.
