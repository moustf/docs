# Introduction to Hamsa Voice Agents

## Overview

Hamsa Telephony is a comprehensive platform for building, testing, deploying, and monitoring reliable AI voice agents. Our platform provides complete solutions for creating conversational AI agents that can handle phone calls naturally, with advanced features for both simple and complex conversation flows.

## What are Voice Agents?

Voice agents are AI-powered conversational systems that can interact with users over phone calls in natural language. They can:

- Answer questions and provide information
- Collect data from callers
- Make decisions based on conversation context
- Execute actions like transferring calls or sending SMS
- Access your company's knowledge base
- Integrate with your existing systems via tools and APIs

## Key Capabilities

### Natural Conversations

Our agents support natural, human-like conversations in multiple languages and dialects, with advanced speech recognition and synthesis capabilities.

### Intelligent Decision Making

Powered by leading LLM models (GPT-4, Claude, etc.), agents can understand context, handle complex scenarios, and make intelligent decisions during conversations.

### Flexible Architecture

Choose between simple single-prompt agents for straightforward use cases, or powerful flow-based agents for complex, multi-step conversations.

### Enterprise-Ready Features

- Real-time call monitoring and testing
- Comprehensive logging and analytics
- Knowledge base integration
- Custom tool/function calling
- Webhook integrations
- Phone number management

## Two Approaches to Building Agents

Hamsa offers two distinct approaches for building voice agents, each suited to different complexity levels and use cases:

### 1. Single Prompt Agent

A single prompt agent uses one comprehensive prompt to define all agent behaviors, making it the simplest approach to get started. Perfect for:

- Simple information gathering
- Basic customer support
- Straightforward appointment booking
- Quick prototypes and MVPs

**When to use:** Your agent has a clear, linear conversation flow with minimal branching logic.

### 2. Flow Agent

Flow agents allow you to create complex, visual conversation flows with multiple nodes and conditional transitions. Ideal for:

- Multi-step processes with conditional logic
- Complex customer service workflows
- Advanced call routing and transfers
- Integration-heavy applications

**When to upgrade:** Consider using a flow agent when your single prompt exceeds 500 words, requires complex decision trees, or needs more than 3 custom tools.

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Agent Type** - Decide between Single Prompt or Flow Agent based on your use case
2. **Configure Global Settings** - Set up voice, language, LLM model, and behavior settings
3. **Design Your Conversation** - Write prompts (Single Prompt) or design flow (Flow Agent)
4. **Add Integrations** - Connect knowledge bases, tools, and webhooks
5. **Test Thoroughly** - Use our browser and phone testing capabilities
6. **Deploy** - Assign phone numbers and go live
