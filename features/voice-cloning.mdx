</Info>

## How Voice Cloning Works

1. **Provide Audio Sample** - Upload or record voice audio
2. **Configure Voice Details** - Name, tags, language, dialect
3. **Processing** - System analyzes and creates AI voice model
4. **Preview & Test** - Generate TTS preview to hear result
5. **Use in Agents** - Select custom voice like any library voice

<Note>
Voice cloning quality depends on audio sample quality. Clear, noise-free recordings produce the best results.
