title: 'Knowledge Base'
description: 'Give your AI agents instant access to your company knowledge, documents, and data'
---

## Overview

The Knowledge Base allows you to upload information that your AI agents can reference during conversations. Add company policies, product documentation, FAQs, pricing information, or any other content your agents need to answer questions accurately.

<Info>
**Three ways to add knowledge:**
- **Upload Documents** - PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML, EPUB files
- **Add URLs** - Web pages and online documentation
- **Free Text** - Direct text entry for quick content
</Info>

## How It Works

When you add items to your Knowledge Base:

1. **Upload** - You submit text, URLs, or files
2. **Processing** - The system extracts and indexes the content
3. **Availability** - Agents can access the information during calls
4. **Usage** - AI retrieves relevant information based on conversation context

<Note>
Knowledge Base items are available to all agents in your project. Select which items each agent can access in the agent's configuration.
</Note>

The system fetches the web page content at the time of creation. If the web page updates later, you'll need to re-add the URL to get fresh content.
</Warning>

### Document (File Upload)

Upload files with structured content.

**Supported Formats:**

- **PDF** - `.pdf`

<Tip>
For best results, use well-formatted documents with clear headings and structure. The AI extracts and indexes text, so complex layouts may not preserve all formatting.

### Edit Item Name

1. Find the item in the list
2. Click the **Actions** menu (⋮)
3. Select **Edit Title**
4. Enter new name (1-100 characters)

<Note>
Editing the name doesn't affect the item's content, only its display name.
</Note>

### Download Items

Download the original content:

**Text Items**: Downloads as `.txt` file
**URL Items**: Downloads extracted content as `.txt`
**Document Items**: Downloads original file in its format

<Warning>
**Deletion Protection:**
If an item is currently used in any agent, you must first remove it from all agents before deleting. This prevents accidentally breaking agent knowledge.
</Warning>

### Activate/Deactivate Items

Control item availability without deleting:

**Active** - Item is available for agents to use
**Inactive** - Item is hidden from agent selection

Toggle status from the item actions menu.

<Tip>
Use Inactive status to temporarily hide outdated information without losing it permanently.
</Tip>

## Using Knowledge Base in Agents

### In Single Prompt Agents

1. Open your Single Prompt Agent
2. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Knowledge Base**
3. Click **Add Knowledge Base Items**
4. Select items from the list
5. Selected items appear in the agent's knowledge base section
6. Save the agent

**What happens:**

- The AI can reference selected knowledge during calls
- Relevant information is retrieved based on conversation context
- Only completed items can be selected

### In Flow Agents

Knowledge Base works the same way in Flow Agents:

1. Open your Flow Agent settings
2. Navigate to **Knowledge Base** tab
3. Select items to make available
4. The entire flow can reference this knowledge

**In Conversation Nodes:**

- The AI automatically retrieves relevant knowledge
- No special configuration needed per node
- Knowledge is available throughout the flow

## Best Practices

### Content Quality

**Use clear, concise language:**

```
Good: "Our return window is 30 days from purchase date."
Bad: "Well, um, we have this policy where you can kinda return stuff..."
```

**Structure information logically:**

```
Good:
"Shipping Times:
- Standard: 5-7 business days
- Express: 2-3 business days
- Overnight: Next business day"

Bad:
"We ship standard in about 5-7 days usually, and if you want express
that's 2-3 days, oh and overnight gets there next day..."
```

**Include specific details:**

```
Good: "Customer service hours: Monday-Friday 9 AM - 6 PM EST"
Bad: "We're usually available during business hours"
```

### Naming Conventions

**Be descriptive:**

```
Good: "2024 Return Policy - Electronics"
Bad: "Returns", "Doc1", "Policy"
```

**Include dates for versioned content:**

```
Good: "Product Catalog - Q1 2024"
Good: "Employee Handbook - January 2024"
```

**Use consistent naming:**

```
"FAQ - Shipping"
"FAQ - Returns"
"FAQ - Payments"
```

### Organization

**Group related content:**

- Create separate items for different topics
- Don't combine unrelated information
- Use clear names to show relationships

**Keep items focused:**

```
Good: One item per topic
- "Shipping Policy"
- "Return Policy"
- "Warranty Information"

Bad: Everything in one item
- "All Policies and Information"
```

**Update regularly:**

- Review knowledge base quarterly
- Remove outdated items
- Update changed information
- Archive old versions

### Content Size

**Text Items:**

- Aim for 100-2,000 characters
- Break long content into multiple items
- Maximum 10,000 characters per item

**Documents:**

- Keep files under 5MB when possible
- Split large manuals into chapters
- Maximum 10MB per file

**URLs:**

- Choose focused pages over entire websites
- Avoid pages with excessive navigation/ads
- Content-heavy pages work best

## Usage Analytics

Track how your knowledge base is performing:

**Word Count** - Shows content depth

- Helps identify thin vs comprehensive content
- Available in list view and sorting

**Used Status** - Shows agent usage

- Filter to see which items are actually used
- Identify unused items for review/deletion

**File Size** - Shows document complexity

- Monitor storage usage
- Identify large files for optimization

## Auto-Save Drafts

When adding knowledge base items, drafts are automatically saved:

**Features:**

- Saved to browser localStorage
- Recover work after browser close
- Separate drafts for Text, URL, and Document
- Warning before navigating away with unsaved changes

**Draft Indicators:**

- Badge shows "Continue with saved draft"
- Draft description shows what's ready
- One draft per item type

**Draft Lifecycle:**

1. Start adding item
2. Fill in form fields
3. Navigate away → draft saved
4. Return later → draft loads automatically
5. Complete and save → draft removed

## Troubleshooting

### URL Processing Failed

**Possible causes:**

- URL is not reachable
- Page requires authentication
- URL points to media file
- Page has anti-scraping protection

**Solutions:**

- Verify URL is accessible in browser
- Use public pages (no login required)
- Ensure URL is HTTPS
- Try a different page from the same site

### Document Upload Failed

**Possible causes:**

- File size exceeds 10MB
- File is corrupted
- Unsupported file format
- Network connection issue

**Solutions:**

- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify file opens correctly on your computer
- Ensure file extension is supported (.pdf, .docx, .txt, .html, .epub)
- Try uploading again

### Document Reading Failed

**Possible causes:**

- File is password protected
- File has complex formatting
- File contains only images (no text)
- File is corrupted

**Solutions:**

- Remove password protection
- Save as simpler format (e.g., .txt)
- Ensure file contains extractable text
- Re-export file from source application

### Item Not Appearing in Agent

**Possible causes:**

- Item is still processing
- Item failed to process
- Item is inactive
- Item not selected in agent configuration

**Solutions:**

### Filter Conflicts
