# Build Your First Voice Agent

Get started with Hamsa by creating a simple customer support agent. This guide will have you up and running in about 10 minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Agent Type">
    For this quickstart, we'll create a **Single Prompt Agent** - the fastest way to get started.

    Navigate to **Agents** → **Create New Agent** → **Single Prompt**

  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Agent">
    Give your agent a descriptive name:

    ```
    Agent Name: Customer Support Bot
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Write the Greeting">
    Set the first message callers will hear:

    ```
    Greeting: "Thank you for calling! I'm here to help. How can I assist you today?"
    ```

    Choose **Static** for greeting type.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Write the Preamble">
    This is your agent's core instructions. Copy and paste this template:

    ```
    ## Identity
    You are a helpful customer support assistant for Acme Corporation.

    ## Style Guardrails
    - Be concise (keep responses under 2 sentences unless explaining complex topics)
    - Be conversational and friendly
    - Use natural language and contractions
    - Be empathetic and patient

    ## Response Guidelines
    - Ask only one question at a time
    - Confirm understanding by paraphrasing
    - If you don't know something, be honest

    ## Task
    Your goal is to help customers with:
    1. General product questions
    2. Account inquiries
    3. Technical support issues

    If the issue requires human assistance, politely inform the caller
    that you'll connect them with a specialist.
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Voice & Language">
    - **Language**: English (US)
    - **Voice**: Choose any voice - try `aura-asteria-en` for a friendly female voice

    <Tip>
    Preview voices before selecting to find the perfect match for your brand
    </Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Call Settings">
    Use these recommended settings for natural conversation:

    - **Response Delay**: 400ms (default)
    - **Allow Interruptions**: ON
    - **User Inactivity Timeout**: 15 seconds
    - **Max Call Duration**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Agent">
    Click **Test Agent** in the top right.

    **Browser Test:**
    1. Click "Start Test" in browser
    2. Allow microphone access
    3. Have a conversation with your agent
    4. Check real-time logs in the sidebar

    **Phone Test (Optional):**
    1. Click "Test via Phone"
    2. Enter your phone number
    3. Receive a call from your agent

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy (Optional)">
    To make your agent live:

    1. Go to **Phone Numbers** tab
    2. Purchase or connect a phone number
    3. Assign it to your agent
